💡Key Insights 
Mumbai is generating the highest revenue and also has a higher room rate (ADR) compared to other cities.
Delhi has lower room occupancy, meaning fewer rooms are being filled.
In Week 24, ADR dropped, which indicates a possible decrease in demand during that week.
Realisation% changes across booking platforms — for example, direct bookings and OTA bookings perform differently.
Most of the revenue comes from only two categories, contributing around 62% of total revenue.
